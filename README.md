Fantasy Football Archives
=========================

This humble README will act as the written archive of Fantasy Football league results. Indeed, Yahoo keeps track of this sort of thing, but because these results span different leagues I though it would be more convenient to pull them all together here.

2014 Year in review
===================
Becasue we didn't want to have a 14-man league in 2014 we split the league into two conferences: Yuengling Conference and Cheesesteak Conference. This wasn't actually a great idea, as having 8-man leagues made getting good players too easy.
