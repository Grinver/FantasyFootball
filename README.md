Fantasy Football Archives
=========================

This humble README will act as the written archive of Fantasy Football league results. Indeed, Yahoo keeps track of this sort of thing, but because these results span different leagues I thought it would be more convenient to pull them all together here.

2016 Season
===========
The second year of the Dick G. Yuengling league featured a return to the (far better) one-week championship game format. Also, for the first time, we retained the same league with all of the same owners. ALSO, this marks the second year in a row that the QB combo of Russell Wilson and Captain Kirk Cousins guided a team through the championship. Incredible.

Champion - SportsScience (Steve)

2015 Season
===========
The inagural year of the Dick G. Yuengling league was hastily put together the day before the first game of the season. Saw new comers: Amelia and Nick Nack. It should also be noted that this year we tried a two-week championship round where the final championship game (and consulation game) spaned the last two weeks of the fantasy season. This was weird and sucked.

2014 Season
===================
Becasue we didn't want to have a 14-man league in 2014 we split the league into two conferences: Yuengling Conference and Cheesesteak Conference. This wasn't actually a great idea, as having 8-man leagues made getting good players too easy. Additionally it meant Jess and I were in each of the two conferences, which wasn't fun.
